# explain-my-model
Explain My Model is a lightweight, model-agnostic Explainable AI (XAI) toolkit that provides human-interpretable explanations for machine learning predictions using global, local, and counterfactual methods.

## Global Explanations
The toolkit provides global feature importance using SHAP values,
highlighting which features most influence model predictions.

Example output:
- Mean |SHAP value| per feature
- SHAP summary plots
